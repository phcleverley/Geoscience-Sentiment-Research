the presence of gas wells, without an oil leg, in the eastern part of the field, suggests that oil migration from troll east field may be unlikely
many hydrocarbon accumulations in vietnam and china (and elsewhere) may have been missed because exploration wells stopped drilling as soon as granitic rocks were encountered in the belief that it was economic basement and no hydrocarbons could be housed there
the permo-carboniferous tasmania basin succession will not have been charged from lower palaeozoic sources
the porosity of clastic reservoirs is impaired by proximity to dolerite (woods  1995)
there is, however, no proven correlation of the condensate with any candidate source rocks
this oil is believed to have either been biodegraded or water-washed because of adjacency to a fault
whereas oil-prone source rocks are rare
where these shales alternate in thin layers with limestones on the adjoining carbonate banks of the bombay high and ratnagiri shelf, they are generally immature
many fields  particularly those in the mirnin area in northeastern nepa-botuoba are affected by faults that compartmentalize reservoirs
having drilled two dry holes, the companies stopped to reconsider their exploratory efforts
dependent upon a long chain of critical events and therefore seems likely to fail
presumed to be leaking
both freshwater molasse successions are devoid of productive reservoirs
a paucity of available samples of possible hydrocarbon source rocks in the marine lower devonian
these source rocks are limited in regional extent because they were deposited within grabens
two structures on possible migration routes from troll east field have been tested and are dry
there is some risk that these faults will instead allow the hydrocarbons to escape upwards into overlying tertiary sedimentary rocks
a few wells have penetrated paleocene sediments and possibly the upper cretaceous, but they are not considered to be important from a source rock perspective due to the advanced thermal stress experienced by these sequences
pursue opportunities on a helter-skelter basis
distinctly lower total hydrocarbon yields
these are particularly common within a potential 'waste zone' developed between the top of the ssg reservoir and the base of the lowest effective halite seal (fig
Some hydrocarbons have been generated and migrated from Archaean organic-rich shales, but they were probably not of sufficient volume to be of commercial interest
exhumation can also lead to loss of charge due to seal breach resulting from the pressure reduction as overburden is reduced, resulting in loss hydrocarbon charge from reservoirs
most published maturity modelling studies suggest that the oil prone jurassic source rocks are either mature for gas generation or overmature and that large volumes of oil was generated prior to deposition of the upper palaeocene reservoir
lack of lateral seal, reservoir and migration were reported as the main reasons for dry prospects
the whale and horseshoe basins are considered to be less prospective than other southwest grand banks basins because they were subjected to extensive erosion of jurassic sediments during the avalon uplift
the lack of success to date is related to fully understanding the key geological controls within the basins
the nearby greenslopes-1 well  located in a highly structured zone  represents high risk leak potential from migrated hydrocarbons and was drilled in a zone of low seal potential
however, this unit cannot be a major source rock in the colorado plateau province because it extends only a few miles north
consequently, reservoirs in those areas particularly the objective lower miocene kujlng unit i, may have been damaged by diagenesis before being available to primary petroleum migration from the deeper source-rock areas
the middle-lower stanley ville group has a max toc of up to 4% to 8% while outcrop data reveals that the ro of this oil source is only 07%; this indicates that this source rock is still immature in most regions of the congo basin
exploring for oil and gas is not easy
as a result, the reservoir thicknesses are uneven, with a restricted distribution in lateral direction (especially at the upper side of the half graben)
according to wright et al (2006), hydrocarbons reservoirs within low accommodation fluvial depositional environments are notoriously difficult to understand in a rigorous stratigraphic framework (ratcliffe et al, 2004, 2006)
lesser amounts of coal are found to the eastern margin
the remaining part of the faroese shelf is characterised by palaeogene flood basalts of varying thickness, which reduce seismic imaging quality of pre-basalt exploration targets, adding an extra challenge to this frontier area
however  due to their likely poor lateral continuity  most of these mudstone units are expected to act as only local top seals for the potential reservoirs
the basin lies in a structurally complex area
preclude existence of source rocks
the brazilian reservoirs include highly complex layered carbonates, hard to characterize at the best of times
there is also no evidence of karroo oil generation
all lower cretaceous, jurassic, carboniferous, and devonian samples have a very low potential for oil or gas generation
however, one major challenge in the discovery of hydrocarbon in the nigerian sector of the basin has been the presence of intrusive igneous bodies in most of the wells drilled
very little exinitic material was recognized
less is known about the neocomian kissenda shale source rocks because they are encountered in only a few onshore wells
this unit, however, appears to be too shallow over most of the basin to be thermally mature
the existence of only a few fine cap rocks might be the major factor in trapping the migrated hydrocarbons
prospecting process leads to advocacy
a subsequent phase of inversion in the basin breached the traps
the relatively difficult resevoirs have meant other projects have been preferred
the high inertinite contents recorded dramatically downgrade any source potential, as inertinite is considered incapable of generating hydrocarbons
invalid fault intersections
validity of the structural closure is unknown and hydrocarbon migration pathways unproven
the results from seismic stratigraphy are partly in contradiction to the conventional stratigraphic framework will recent palynological results
detailed stratigraphic correlation with subsurface data have consequently faced up more difficulties and hampered by limited biogenic remains dating
analyses of the upper albian to cenomanian madiela and cap lopez formations in the north and south gabon subbasins (figs 19 and 20) have shown excellent source rock potential, but data from these units are scarce
upper-fan or turbidite-channel deposits are less well sorted and therefore have lower porosities
personal hubris/arrogance
the factors controlling porosity within the aguathuna formation (the productive zone in pap#1) are not well understood and the porosity appears to be highly variable
the porosity of these basal sandstones is poor, averaging about 12 percent where measurable
these sandstones have the ability to act as thief zones causing leakage of hydrocarbon charge and also to degrade structural closures by acting as an uppermost  low net-to-gross reservoir zone
it was not risked properly
various maturity parameters indicated immature or possibly early mature organic matter
the relatively low relief, perhaps 50m at both reservoir levels, means that the traps risks will chiefly arise from seismic acquisition and depth conversion problems
this suggests that the failure of well 42/12-2  where the mmg was less than 600m thick  may have been due to top seal ineffectiveness
uplift that reached a maximum in middle cretaceous time had the potential to remove reservoir rocks and breach traps and cooling may have halted hydrocarbon generation
because mainly oil is produced from niobrara reservoirs that are thermally mature with respect to oil (ro 060 to 135 percent) and niobrarasourced oil is not found in other reservoir rocks  it appears that little or no migration has taken place
the parlgi limestone and other miocene reefs were deposited somewhat later and probably missed the early migrating petroleum
seal is regarded as the prime cause of failure of the trap
exited play too soon
these shows may have little significance as regard to petroleum potential as such occurrences have been "essentially the same in dsdp coring worldwide"
of some concern are the blanket sandstones of the shelf part of the basin (belumal formation), which extend to the outcrop area, and where there has been extensive flushing of reservoirs on a regional scale
the carboniferous sediments encountered in the orphan basin (see figure 57) have been described as meta-sediments in some wells but it is the subject of some debate whether these wells are representative of the carboniferous throughout the basin
however, caution should be exercised in extrapolating the results to other parts of the basin, and they need to be viewed in the context of a limited sample base in an inadequately explored basin
some higher values have also been measured, but the formation is thermally immature throughout the basin
migration of hydrocarbons from the cis-sayan syneclise onto the baykit anticlise may have been impeded by deformation
the overlying open-marine telisa or gumal shale appears to be a poor environment for organic preservation and probably is not an appreciable source
the geologist was not pessimistic enough
it is clear that these features postdate hydrocarbon generation and migration in the basin and do not form effective traps
a great deal remains unknown about the offstructure basin stratigraphy
lower devonian sandstones are usually well-cemented, hard and tight, and original porosity has largely been destroyed by deep burial
not passed economic theshold
yielded the only low ro for the 'lower' eastern view coal measures raises doubts about the ro values for these two samples
this resulted in deep erosion of their mesozoic and palaeozoic sedimentary cover and the destruction of their hydrocarbon potential
the nalbia sandstone of the byro group is unlikely to be sealed effectively
the turonian to coniacian mesa and lago members of the iabe formation (fig 15) contain sandstone reservoir rocks with interbedded limestone and dolomite; these reservoir units display variable porosity and permeability (schoellkopf and patterson, 2000
further east, outcrops of the shallow-marine sandstones that occur towards the top of the lower devonian sequence contain little or no carbonaceous matter and only minor intercalated shale, and are thus throught to have little or no source rock potential
interpretive pitfalls
the source rock quality parameters are indicative of poor to fair generation characteristics
the unit has a sub-surface which extension was historically limited to its outcrops area
pore-filling smectite affects reservoir porosity and permeability in the dinantian of the clair field, and could be a potential source of serious reservoir damage arising from swelling
simply being able to map these complex, poorly visualized reservoirs is a difficult task
and the minor remaining untested middle miocene-pliocene sandstones with less effective sealing are perhaps 70 percent oil
in addition, numerous holes drilled by the deep sea drilling project (dsdp) and its successor the ocean drilling project (odp) have shown the sediments of the ocean basins to be generally fine-grained and poor in reservoir quality, very poor in organic carbon, and near flat-lying in attitude, which would prevent migration and trapping of any hydrocarbons formed (table i, eg hedberg, 1983;katz, 1986) 
although good reservoirs and several oil and gas shows (figure 71) gave encouragement, no discoveries resulted
reservoirs are likely to be poor to fair due to high proportion of volcanic lithic grains sourced from the antarctic peninsula volcanic arc
but this occurs in circumstances where the upper cretaceous marine source rocks are over mature and/or completely absent
this slowing is quite evident in the democratic republic of the congo part of the congo basin (figs 13 and 14), where the post-salt source rock (madingo marl) is immature, and in the congo basin and south gabon subbasin, where the miocene malembo and mandorove formations (figs 15 and 19), respectively, are mostly immature
removing potential reservoir and source rocks
impossible geological interpretation
the largest field has probably already been found
despite the promise offered by the argentine south atlantic margin, tentative exploration in a number of basins has yielded largely discouraging results
the design of the well, a horizontal well with 2 open-hole side-tracks (figure 4), is such that little information can be gleaned as to the contribution of this unit to the overall production
abrupt changes in the reservoir properties of the sandstones result from diagenesis  including silicification  halitization and sulphatization  which are irregular and unpredictable
all intervals except for the jurassic have undergone thermal stress inadequate for decomposition of om
burial depths are not great, and source rocks may only be mature in the deepest parts of the western offshore area
to date, drilling outside the region of known production has been disappointing
however, the subsequent history of the basin may have led to this early oil being flushed from either, or both of the reservoirs
the alolo formation shale in the devonian has a limited lateral extension and a local sealing capacity
imperfect seal
no post-audits
the whisby wells have proven the early westphalian basal sandstone structural play in the area, although the reservoir is locally absent and generally less than 10m thick
there was no trapping mechanism present at either prospect
poor reservoir continuity
geochemical data are scarce for this formation
because of the risks of losses through long-distance lateral migration and diversion at faults  it is unlikely that significant quantities of gas and condensate generated in the amak or north aleutian basins would reach traps on the black hills uplift
could not elevate temperatures high enough for petroleum generation
there are several hydrocarbon discoveries, but commercial success has so far been elusive
limited knowledge of distribution of source interval
in the eastern parts of the basin, the rate of oil generation slowed after the cretaceous owing to the lack of further deposition of tertiary overburden rocks (schoellkopf and patterson, 2000)
there is consistent evidence from a number of criteria that the lower permian potential source rocks in the north of the basin are immature to marginally mature
many of the wells tested traps too far updip on the shallow shelf
these are not mature onshore  probably due to the shallow depth of burial
adding to the poor potential for these sediments as reservoir rocks is the interbedding of volcanics in the cretaceous portion of the heama-1  kachi-1 and inga-1 wells (figure 5)
however  this would requires 50+ miles of lateral migration through the highly faulted southwest part of the north aleutian basin  with great risk of diversion of migrating petroleum up faults and loss to surface seeps
viable organic-rich source rocks have yet to be
gross descriptions report an abundance of graywackes and subgraywackes in the section, indicating less favorable reservoir quality
poor toc
at source rock level the mechanism of pressure retardation of the source rock might take place
the source rock had low toc percentage
the high temperatures of pyrolysisgas chromatography produce compounds rarely observed in petroleum (eg, abundant n-alkenes) and complicate correlation of source rocks with oils (gormly and mukhopadhyay, 1983)
it is not clear if a working petroleum system exists
exploration wells were dry  allegedly because of lack of seal
this is the poorest unit with respect to om content
these source rocks are characterized by great lateral and vertical variability  leading to a very irregular distribution of organic matter
incomplete or inconsistent reporting of temperature and time data restricted the precision with which some corrections could be made
source rocks in outcrop are not mature, and even offshore burial depths may not have been sufficient to generate significant quantities of hydrocarbons in some areas
no atrractive source formations in known tertiary-age rocks
also, because of the many small carbonate traps of unpredictable reservoir properties, many wells will be required to establish the petroleum potential of the carbonate play
offshore, we interpret a basinward loss of turonian source rocks based on seismically displayed thinning of the interval and disappearance of the oil type
is downgraded as a potential hydrocarbon source rock
a number of still existing exploration prospects is associated with stratigraphic and structural traps that have so far proven difficult to image
the failure to encounter hydrocarbon accumulations which at present seem economically feasible was mainly related to the lack of sealing lithologies  with high net sand to gross interval thickness ratios
in other cases  the wells tested offstructure or where the structural trap may not have been present
(1998) have argued that they might be derived from an as-yet unidentified southern margin petroleum system  or represent historical artifacts of the early whaling and seal harvesting industry  but proof for either proposition is still lacking
one of the critical components in any of these deep plays would be depth of burial and the possibility of overmaturity in the deeper parts of the basin
vitrinite reflectance values are low (04 to 06 percent) in rocks younger than the cambay shale onshore
consequently, the risk from lack of migration increases southwards from whisby towards bassingham
we consider it unlikely that significant quantities of effective triassic oil source rocks survive
although these shales have sufficient organic content, they are not mature in outcrop
rocks in these two wells are likely to yield biogenic gas and immature oil making them low grade source rocks
high-maturity, organic-rich calcareous shales of this age have been penetrated in the eastern gulf of mexico, and tithonian oils occur in cretaceous reservoirs on the florida shelf where the upper cretaceous and tertiary sections are immature
stated that no significant source rocks were found in the mostly carbonate gneudna formation penetrated by quail 1
the primarily terrestrially sourced material, consisting of types-ii and -iii kerogen (das and others, 1987), is similar to, but not as rich in total organic carbon (toc) as, the correlative eocene cambay shale of the cambay-hazad and cambay-kalol petroleum systems to the north (banerjee and rao, 1993; biswas and others, 1994; samanta, 2000)
fault seal is required to charge known accumulations and match known hydrocarbon column heights, but extending shale smear into the nubian sandstone prevents the crestal october field structure from charging
highly lenticular and isolated reservoi breached trap due to overpressure
causing reservoir quality and thickness of net sand to deteriorate
most of the samples in wells wctp  have tmax< 435 0c and pi <th immature and non-indigenous
restored tops not used
discovery lacks a commercial accumulation of hydrocarbons
although these are still below average for good quality shale source rock
a lack ofadequate structures may explain the dearth of discoveries
other stage 1 facies generally are relatively thin and laterally discontinuous
no accumulation
the low ratio of [20s/20s+20r] c29 steranes of about 04  which in turn low maturity level of hydrocarbon generation of alam el-bueib and abu roash-g members shale source rocks
the overall finding rates for wells drilled during the 70 year exploration of the weald basin provide a poor guide to its chances of success, owing to the early focus on structures formed during the alpine inversion,
deeper burial leads to enhanced maturity levels while mistaking the effects of deeper burial for elevated heat flow can lead to incorrect discounting of deep source potential
low toc
trap failure is the main reason for dry well as fault besides the trap has high potential of leaking
fault reactivation probably represents a significant risk to the integrity of traps that may have been charged in the jurassic cretaceous thermal maximum
the inglewood well shown in figure 83 failed to reach its target depth and was abandoned at 700 metres
a few wells have penetrated paleocene sediments and possibly the upper cretaceous, but they are not considered to be important from a source rock perspective due to the advanced thermal stress experienced by these sequences
tmax from rock-eval pyrolysis (table 2) ranges from 343-426oc indicating immature conditions of the shales
the basins have low heat flows and the abundant, immature, volcaniclastic turbidites have poor reservoir characteristics
its reservoir properties in brockham-1 are inferior to those of the portland sandstone and, despite some oil shows, it tested 130 bwpd
may be complicated by the need to establish long-distance migration pathways
over-mature and in gas window
rockeval data show that the remainder of the formation is a lean potential  source rock that is both oil and gasprone
maturation can be a significant risk for the outer parts of dwftbs on passive margins near the continentocean transition, as the dual decrease in heat flow and sediment thickness reduce the source rock maturation potential
the lower devonian marine sequence of the darling basin has a low organic carbon content,
the main liability in the deepwater area is that in places the sedimentary overburden of potential source rocks is not sufficiently thick for their maturation
however, they may also break the seals, an aspect that must be taken into account when evaluating tectonic evolution of the area following the first accumulation of hydrocarbon
(1998) have argued that they might be derived from an as-yet unidentified southern margin petroleum system  or represent historical artifacts of the early whaling and seal harvesting industry  but proof for either proposition is still lacking
diagenetic alteration can also degrade porosity and permeability (winn et al  1993)
this may indicate that low maturity middle triassic hydrocarbon source rocks may be widely present in the northern barents shelf
but 40%  cos > 31% over-confidence in the risking assessment
immature sr
it is not known if the cambro-ordovician carbonate platform extends beneath the bay st george carboniferous sediments (figure 85) because of poor seismic resolution below the windsor salt
the major risk to oil generation is maturity
finally the issue of reservoir rocks must be addressed
the generation and infilling of rift basins creates a number of potential hydrocarbon plays, although analysis of individual play elements indicates a relatively high risk, despite the prevalence of hydrocarbons derived from the same rift sequence elsewhere in the basin
the sherwood sandstone is considered to be absent or in non-reservoir facies across tq14
the thick coarse-grained fluviatile sediments of middle devonian to early carboniferous age appear to have negligible source potential, owing to their continental affinities and the redbed character of associated fine-grained clastics
skimp on data acquisition costs
this is at odds with the conjugate canadian basins that have enjoyed success since the beginnings of exploration in the 60s and 70s
hydrocarbons generated from the thebes formation contribute only minor volumes to the predicted accumulations
no reservoir was identified in this section
inaccurate correlations
it has not been possible to map the depths to specific source rock intervals in basalt-covered areas due to lack of well ties and poor seismic imaging
a paucity of available samples of possible hydrocarbon source rocks in the marine lower devonian
possible: neocomian and jurassic limestones (too deep?)
toc was 01%
the luwumbu formation provides the only source rock assemblage in the luangwa valle
it is doubtful whether appreciable porosity in the berriedale limestone and its lithologic correlates survived until the most likely time of hydrocarbon migration in the mid-jurassic to mid-cretaceous
the formation therefore did not attain maturity
a medium rating is assigned to wilderness lands that have all the attributes, including shows, of an oil and gas producing area, but presently lack commercial production
many operating companies have worked on jeffara area delivering a lot of data that unfortunately show many divergences especially within nomenclature of stratigraphic drilled sections
because of poor source rocks, low expelled masses 
there is an inherent risk of error in the data acquisition
immature source
this conclusion suggests lateral migration can be of limited efficiency and/or that the source rocks are too lean to generate sufficient hydrocarbons to fll the available trap capacity
seismic shows that the section below the messinian salt basin is well defined in the eastern portion of ne mediterranean block, but stratigraphic events are more difficult to identify in the west
faulting within these blocks is not intense  and although it probably breached early seals in some fields (eg
good oil and gas source rocks in the paleozoic section appear to be sparse in the colorado plateau province of arizon
therefore, only small numbers of undiscovered fields were estimated
the then generated gas was lost, likely due to poor seal integrity
these factors suggest that there may be fewer good sandstone reservoirs and that the source rocks may not be buried sufficiently for peak generation of hydrocarbons
however an effective top seal may be lacking
high risk due to excessive reservoir depth or likely replacement of reservoir by volcanics in the subsurface
despite the efforts of many workers, the common correlation scheme of the cambro-ordovician in algeria is based on a subdivision into four informal lithozones which are from base to top: r3, r2, ra (anisotropic reservoirs-supposed lower cambrian) and ri (isotropic reservoir-supposed ordovician)
most wells are dry or with minor shows
gas accumulations, along the north flank of the weald basin such as those in the corallian limestone of the bletchingley field and the purbeckian sandstones of the albury field (see trueman 2003) lack a conventional source, since burial histories show that the jurassic section in the basin has nowhere entered the gas window
miocene to pleistocene section is immature for hydrocarbon generation
drilling has not taken place due to jurisdictional disputes
marine source rocks probably occur in eastern indonesia, but are poorly documented
cities drilled 1 well (dry) in southern offshore
the oil source potential of the jurassic rocks is not high
in contrast to the black sea basin, the hydrocarbon potential of the algero-provenqal, tyrrhenian and aegean back-arc basins is questionable
because of the complex geology, identifying these reservoirs and successfully positioning wells is challenging
in lurestan, the kazhdumi is not a source rock anymore and the pabdeh is not mature, moreover, the asmari reservoir is breached, and the sarvak has almost everywhere a tight basinal facies
during the post-rift stage, thick volcaniclastic sediments accumulated (eocene kusuri formation) and have limited source and reservoir potential
late-stage lake shrinkage or the restricted distribution of fine-grained lacustrine facies implies that the southern manghan basin hardly has a regional topseal  and the fuxin formation will also not provide good source beds
but proven resources have been small
the organic content of rocks in the east java basin generally is meager
poor reservoir quality
sealing lithologies  were for the most part deficient
generation of hydrocarbons from riphean source rocks is thought to have begun during the riphean and to have been completed during the vendian but  as discussed above  much of the early generated hydrocarbons are likely to have been lost during formation of the pre-vendian unconformity (mel'nikov 1994)
these data suggest that mesozoic oil source beds do not underlie north aleutian basin in the area of play
the aptian-albian syn-rift series of the black sea, although containing black shales, do not have an obvious source-rock potential (robinson et al 1996)
shales would probably be overmature for hydrocarbon generation
the origin of hydrocarbons and their migration are not fully understood
however, because it lacks a cap rock in the upper loia formation, the detrital sand reservoir in the uppermost part of this formation does not fit the conditions for hydrocarbon accumulation
a subsequent phase of inversion in the basin breached the traps
plugged and abandoned no shows
in this deep-water frontier area, reservoir development is probably a major risk element

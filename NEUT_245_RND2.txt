the cambro-ordovician sandstones are one of the main oil reservoirs in algeria
they are, in the most part a braided fluvial system and the reservoir is subdivided into four lithozones (r3, r2, ra, ri) based on grain size and wireline logs signatures.
early workers in the area tried to integrate outcrop and borehole lithostratigraphy to help understand the geology of the newly discovered oil reservoirs (gevin, 1960; legrand, 1962; legrand and nabos, 1962; freulon, 1964; l’homer, 1967), while the first major synthesis of the cambro-ordovician was undertaken by beuf et al.

for example in general the paleogene agbada–akata formations are thought to be the main source rocks for the niger delta including the deepwater
additionally, the source rocks in the western gulf are from carbonate-marl sequences, while source rocks are predominantly carbonate-marl to clastic sequences in the eastern gulf
these variations in source rock type are reflected in the oil chemistry
for smaller deltas, and many salt detachment-dominated passive margins, the potential age-range of source rocks is wide since the effects of burial discussed above are not as strong
the timing of sub-dwftb source rocks is critical
